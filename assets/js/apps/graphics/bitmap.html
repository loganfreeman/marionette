				This example demonstrates the effect of <strong>DisplayObject.cache()</strong>
				and <strong>snapToPixel</strong> on performance. Caching can provide
				performance benefits for some types of content because the complex
				vector shapes do not have to be re-rendered each tick. Different
				browsers have different thresholds for when caching makes sense. The
				results for snapToPixel vary between browsers, but in general it
				will have no effect on the un-cached shapes, but a significant
				effect when cached.

	<strong>Note that Safari 6+ performs worse in this demo with
		caching due to how it handles vectors very well, and small textures
		very poorly.</strong>
